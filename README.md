# Carryable Flags Vanilla


[Carryable Flags - Vanilla - Arma Reforger Workshop](https://reforger.armaplatform.com/workshop/62CA50C50482EA30-CaryableFlags-Vanilla)

A simple extension to CaryableFlags, that adds Vanilla flags.

This project aims to extend the brilliant [HercPlayZ96's CaryableFlags mod](https://reforger.armaplatform.com/workshop/62BF3C345D95EF63-CaryableFlags) by adding flags already available in-game, keeping it lightweight.

Features :
- [x] Only vanilla items
- [x] A variety of flags added to all factions' arsenal boxes
- [x] Flag bearers (new civilian class. Overrides the US, Soviet, and FIA Unarmed classes)
- [x] Full localization in all 13 languages

Known issues
- [ ] None known at this time.


Future
- [ ] Find a Bohemia Interactive flag

What else ?

Thanks to HercPlayZ96 for the inspiration and, of course, Bohemia Interactive for Arma Reforger â€” it's the gift that keeps on giving. i'm lovin' it!
